 We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
